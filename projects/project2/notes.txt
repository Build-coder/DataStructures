Here we go...

Your assignment is to implement a Splay tree
in which we can store the info about several books.

The info to store is the title, author, and text.
The text will be stored in an AVL tree. It means 
that every node in the Splay tree has an AVL tree.

The user will be able to access the text by
searching the Splay tree for a specific title. The
text of every book is stored as words in the AVL tree
The user is able to search the AVL tree and collect
some info about the text. The following presents some
examples of queries:

    - The number of occurrences of a word in a book
    - Check whether a word is commonly used by mult
      authors
    - etc 

You can add your own private variables and functions.
The current private function declarations are provided
as a backbone to help you

Node instance of -> 
WordTree instance of -> 
BNode instance of -> 
BookTree

The class BookTree constructs a Splay tree. 
The nodes in this tree are of type BNode
The key for a node is the title of a book 

wordTree - "BST (Binary Search Tree): Balanced" contains interface and implementation of class Node
bNode - turns each AVL tree into a node (I think)
bookTree - Splay tree

key value: the value the root node of the tree is holding OR maybe just the value in the node
